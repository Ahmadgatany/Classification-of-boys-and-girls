## Files

- `Classify_boys_Vs_girls.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code to train and evaluate the model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the image data for training and testing. Images are organized and resized for training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow
